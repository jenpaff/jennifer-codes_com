<strong>Description:</strong> 
Wonder how this website came to live? Interested in how to create your own? 

When some of my friends were hit by the economic crisis caused by the pandemic & were faced with unemployment, I organised a small hackathon to learn how to create a responsive portfolio website together. Goal was to gain some web development skills and create a fancy website to be more competitive with future applications.
